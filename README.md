# tracing-pi

After failing gloriously with setting up my raspi last time i thought it would be great to have some sort of diary which things i did when.
This project will be used to trace all my steps from installing an OS onto the micro-SD Card to let's see.

As this project will be only used by me the [logbook part](Logbook.md) will be written in german. If you need some parts translated in to english - feel free to contact me.
