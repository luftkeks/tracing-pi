# tracing-pi

After failing gloriously with setting up my raspi last time i thought it would be great to have some sort of diary which things i did when.
This project will be used to trace all my steps from installing an OS onto the micro-SD Card to let's see.

As this project will be only used by me the [logbook part](Logbook.md) will be written in german. If you need some parts translated in to english - feel free to contact me.

After the first try failed i decided to redo the whole thing an start a new [logbook](logbook2.md).

Notice to my future me: here is a good [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) in case you need one.
